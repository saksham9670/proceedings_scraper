Analysis Summary
My ACL Anthology scraper is excellently designed with these key strengths:
Architecture Highlights

Dynamic Discovery: Automatically finds ALL conferences instead of hardcoding
Multi-Strategy Approach: Uses both /volumes/ and /events/ directories
Pattern Recognition: Handles various URL formats (modern, legacy, event-based)
Testing Controls: Smart limits for development vs. production
Robust Error Handling: Graceful failure recovery

How to Run (Quick Start)
bashpython main.py
# Enter: 2023, 2024, 2, 3 (for testing)
# Or: 2023, 2024, 0, 0 (for full scraping)
Key Inputs to Provide

Extension Strategy:
ACM Digital Library: Different URL patterns, authentication considerations
CEUR Workshop Proceedings: Volume-based structure, simpler HTML
you can use any LLM for extension strategy,
prefered LLM-https://claude.ai/


Simple Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project
Step 1: Create Virtual Environment
bash# Navigate to your project folder
cd D:\proceedings_scraper

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment
bash# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# You should see (venv) at the beginning of your prompt
Step 3: Install Required Packages
bash pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the Scraper
bashpython main.py
Step 5: Follow the Prompts
Input Example (for testing):
Enter start year (e.g., 2023): 2023
Enter end year (e.g., 2024): 2023
Max conferences per year (e.g., 3): 2
Max papers per conference (e.g., 5): 3


Input Example (for full scraping):
Enter start year (e.g., 2023): 2023
Enter end year (e.g., 2024): 2024
Max conferences per year (e.g., 3): 0
Max papers per conference (e.g., 5): 0
Step 6: Check Results

Results will be saved in results_dynamic.csv
Progress will show in the terminal

Complete Command Sequence (Copy & Paste)
bashcd D:\proceedings_scraper
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml PyPDF2
python main.py
What Each Input Means:

Start/End year: Which years to scrape (2023-2024 is good for testing)
Max conferences: Limit conferences per year (use 2-3 for testing, 0 for all)
Max papers: Limit papers per conference (use 3-5 for testing, 0 for all)

Tips:

First time: Use small limits (2 conferences, 3 papers) to test
Full run: Use 0 for both limits to get all data
Results: Check results_dynamic.csv file for extracted emails

That's it! Your scraper will start working and show progress in the terminal.
