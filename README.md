Architecture Highlights

Dynamic Discovery: Automatically finds ALL conferences instead of hardcoding
Multi-Strategy Approach: Uses both /volumes/ and /events/ directories
Pattern Recognition: Handles various URL formats (modern, legacy, event-based)
Testing Controls: Smart limits for development vs. production
Robust Error Handling: Graceful failure recovery

How to Run (Quick Start)
bashpython main.py
# Enter: 2023, 2024, 2, 3 (for testing)
# Or: 2023, 2024, 0, 0 (for full scraping)
Key Inputs to Provide

Extension Strategy:
ACM Digital Library: Different URL patterns, authentication considerations
